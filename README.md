# Segment clients of an e-commerce platform

### Mission

We were asked to segment clients of an e-commerce platform using unsupervised models (clustering).

As the segmentation had to be actionable by the marketing team, we needed to find the best trade-off between mathematically well-defined clusters and segment interpretability. 

A thorough feature construction, selection, and transformation (avoiding traps such as using OHE with distance-metric models and applying ad hoc mathematical transformation, etc.) combined with a customer and market understanding were vital to reach the needed trade-off.
